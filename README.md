Octave Plugin
=============

A plugin that adds Octave support to IntelliJ IDEA.

I really appreciate his work and love to code with IntelliJ IDEA. So I decided to extend his plugin to
my purpose and share it for the rest of us. If you enjoy either project feel free to do the same and
please star base projects. All code up to revision six are all Tom Conder ones. The basis for this plugin
and the idea is both the work of him; and I really appreciate his project.
